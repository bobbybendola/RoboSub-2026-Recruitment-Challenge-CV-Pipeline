# RoboSub-2026-Recruitment-Challenge-Computer-Vision-Pipeline
For ROBOSUB UCI - Recruitment 2026. Computer vision pipeline to detect objects colored in RED and its shade in an underwater enviroment using openCV. #Handling noise and filtering using Gaussian Blurring, using HSV and LAB color spaces, and contours for appropriate bounding circles.
#Future possible improvements: Depending on the size of the object to be detected, we can implement a simple if condition filter to only detct object covering a certain
#                              pixel area in the image. This would help eliminate any small red objects that are act as noise in the image. 
#                              We could also further the tool's robutstness by allowing the user to select their color of interest by providing RGB values and detecting 
#                              required color in the image.
